# **App Name**: GraphSim

## Core Features:

- Responsive Split Layout: Implements a responsive split layout with a left control panel for equation input and a right panel for the graph area.
- Theme Toggle: Allows users to switch between a light and dark theme for comfortable viewing in different environments.
- Equation Input: Equation input with a simple textarea field.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep indigo (#4F46E5) to bring a sense of focus, without being distracting. The hue aligns to scientific themes but the styling remains simple.
- Background color: Very light grey (#F9FAFB) for the light theme, near-black (#111827) for the dark theme. This helps create a clean, neutral canvas.
- Accent color: Soft violet (#A78BFA) to highlight interactive elements and calls to action. This adds a subtle, refined emphasis.
- Font: 'Inter' (sans-serif) for both headlines and body text, ensuring a modern, neutral, and easily readable interface. The app content does not call for expressive font pairings, and Inter is suitable for all roles.
- Lucide icons are used to provide a consistent and clean visual language. Favor simple, line-based icons for clarity.
- Split layout with left panel (equation input) and right panel (graph area). Mobile-friendly design with responsive adjustments.
- Subtle transitions and animations on interactive elements to provide feedback and enhance the user experience.
